# Nanopore targeted sequencing to identify TB drug resistance

#### Implementing TBDR sequencing in SA and Zambia

Rapid and comprehensive drug susceptibility testing (DST) is essential for diagnosing and treating drug-resistant tuberculosis effectively and next-generation sequencing can be an effective genotypic DST method. We implemented and evaluated the performance of a nanopore targeted sequencing assay, Tuberculosis Drug Resistance Test (TBDR, Oxford Nanopore Diagnostics Ltd., United Kingdom), which predicts drug resistance to 16 TB drugs, at a South African reference laboratory and a district diagnostic laboratory in Zambia. We compared the sequencing success rates between unprocessed and decontaminated sputum samples and determined the diagnostic accuracy against local DST.
